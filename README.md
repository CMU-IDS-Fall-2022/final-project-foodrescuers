## Abstract

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), between 30 - 40 percent of the food supply in the US is wasted. This corresponds to about 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food in 2010. This is not just a problem in the United States; one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally.

Our app has three main sections. In the first, we offer data exploration of food waste both in the United States and globally via multiple expressive visualizations for. In the second, we offer more detail and break down the environmental impact of many popular food items globally via multiple different metrics: land use, water withdrawal, eutrophication, and greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, in the third, we enable our user to make a difference by helping users come up with a recipe to make with the food they already have in their fridge. We train and deploy a model that takes user input and predicts what recipes they should make.

A theme in our app is to use impactful visualizations and personalized metrics to convince the user of the large scale and importance of the problem of global food waste

## Commentary

We aimed for a narrative-driven approach for our project and focused on visualizations that would either convince the user that food waste is a real problem and/or motivate the user to do something about it. For example, our introductory visualizations are focused on the United States (our main audience) and other on user-selections. That level of personalization helps the user contextualize the problem.

We faced a few issues and learned a lot from solving them. For example, as detailed in our report, we had to make assumptions about portion sizes to calculate conrete numbers for our visualizations. 

Overall, we really enjoyed using what we've learned in this class to create a cohesive project.

## Work distribution

We distributed the work evenly and

Michael mainly worked on the USA visualization section.
Neha mainly worked on the global visualization section.
Jullia mainly worked on the treemap visualization section.
Durvesh and Abubakir mainly worked on the ML predictor.

However, we all helped each other with tasks and wrote the report together.
