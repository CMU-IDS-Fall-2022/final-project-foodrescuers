## Commentary

We aimed for a narrative-driven approach for our project and focused on visualizations that would either convince the user that food waste is a real problem and/or motivate the user to do something about it. For example, our introductory visualizations are focused on the United States (our main audience) and other on user-selections. That level of personalization helps the user contextualize the problem.

We faced a few issues and learned a lot from solving them. For example, as detailed in our report, we had to make assumptions about portion sizes to calculate conrete numbers for our visualizations. 

Overall, we really enjoyed using what we've learned in this class to create a cohesive project.

## Work distribution

We distributed the work evenly and

Michael mainly worked on the introduction section.
Neha mainly worked on the global visualization section.
Jullia mainly worked on the treemap visualization section.
Durvesh and Abubakir mainly worked on the ML predictor.

However, we all helped each other with tasks and wrote the report together.
